For a number of years, I have been in a 32-team fantasy football league. This league is extremely unique. Not only because most leagues have 14 or fewer teams, but the rules are also very unique. Because of this, no standard fantasy website can handle our scoring system. Since the inception of the league, all scoring has been done manual. This means calculating the scores for up to 32 teams, or 288 players, every week! Not only is this an extremely time-consuming task, but it can also lead to human error.

As I approach the end of my bootcamp journey, I envision creating an app that can handle our league. This will be no small feat. The backend, which I will build with Ruby on Rails, will be very complex - way more than I have endured to this point. My initial outline consists of 12 models, but I believe there will be more as the project unfolds. I look forward to the challenge.
