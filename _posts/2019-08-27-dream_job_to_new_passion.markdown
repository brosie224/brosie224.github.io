I've always been a numbers person... I've always been a huge sports fan. When I was as young as ten years old, I can remember creating tons of spreadsheets to prepare for a fantasy sports league or playing seasons and seasons of my favorite sports video games just to analyze the data. Needless to say, when I was hired as a stats analyst at ESPN, I had landed my dream job.

I was at ESPN for just under six years, fortunate to have the opportunity to work with my two passions (sports and numbers) on a daily basis. But, it was at ESPN where I found a new passion - coding. While there I was exposed to SQL and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), my first experiences with any programming language. I fell in love with the idea of identifying areas in need for improvement, thinking of a remedy, and implementing the solution. I took a workshop to hone my skills and eventually created multiple tools that became staples in the ESPN Stats & Analysis Newsroom.

Creating programs was not part of my primary responsibilities at ESPN, and as time went on, I found myself wanting to change that and turn my passion for coding into a career. And that's what I did. I decided to leave my dream job, join a coding bootcamp, and pursue a new career in my newfound passion.
