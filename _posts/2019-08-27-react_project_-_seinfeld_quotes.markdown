The React section was admittedly the most difficult for me to grasp at the beginning. I think this was due to it feeling the most foreign to me. Previous sections, while new for me, were familiar concepts, just different syntax. Through hours of coursework and additional tutorials online, it eventually clicked!

For my React project, I decided to create an app dedicated to Seinfeld quotes. The app has three main features, which allow a user to:

1. List quotes belonging to each of the four main characters
2. Generate a random quote from any character
3. Search thru all quotes with their own query

I used react-bootstrap for styling, but also added some of my own CSS, including styling for the character cards. These styling aspects are subtle, but I believe add a lot to the look of the app. These include having each card pop out when the user hovers over it and graying it all of the characters who weren't clicked by the user.
